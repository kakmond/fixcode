## Run the code

Explain here what is the problem with equals?

>>The equals method for class Object will check for the memory location so it return false because it is not a same memory 

Explain why a.equals(b) can be true, but b.equals(a) can sometime be false.
>>bacause equals() method from the "Object" class will check for the memory location of two objects but equals() method from the "Person" will check the person's name of two Person object and equals() method from the "Student" will check the student's name and student's ID 

## Fix the code.


1. Fix bad naming of method(s) in Person.

2. Write good Javadoc in Person and Student. Include @param for methods with parameters. Use @return to describe what is returned.

3. Write a correct equals( ) method for Person and Student.
